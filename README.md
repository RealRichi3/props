# GPS-Driven Traffic Signal Control System

A distributed reinforcement learning system for traffic signal optimization using GPS-based vehicle route prediction.

## Overview

This project explores a new approach to traffic signal control by combining:
- **GPS-based route prediction** to anticipate vehicle movements
- **Reinforcement learning agents** for adaptive signal timing
- **Distributed learning** across multiple intersections
- **Real-time optimization** with SUMO traffic simulation

The system learns vehicle routing patterns from historical GPS data and uses this knowledge to proactively adjust traffic signals.
