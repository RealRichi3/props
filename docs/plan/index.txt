- Implement data generators
    AIM
    - Review existing real world traffic patterns and try to generate synthetic data that closely relates

- Main implementation 
    - Overall architecture
        - Junction prediction for turn
            - GPS prediction for vehicles - Make this a separate module so you can use other models for GPS turn predictions
            - Other state parameters that will be included should be reviewed 
            - Junction traffic controller
